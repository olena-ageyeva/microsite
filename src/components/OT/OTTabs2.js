                    <p><strong>Q: How is my production level calculated?</strong>

                    <p><strong>A: </strong>We use<strong> </strong>2018 or 2019 prorated production on paid business, including insurance. Fees are based on each individual’s production level and are not transferable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between the single attendee rate and the attendee rate: sharing room/no room needed rate?</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>A: </strong>The <em>single attendee rate</em> is for each attendee who does not plan to share a hotel room with another registered attendee. The <em>sharing room/no room needed</em> <em>rate </em>is for each attendee who either plans to share a hotel room with another registered attendee/advisor or does not require a hotel room. Commonwealth will assign you a roommate unless you indicate a preference on the registration form. This rate does not apply to attendees who are sharing a room with a spouse or other guest who is not a registered conference attendee.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Is the guest fee prorated based on production?</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>A: </strong>This year, the primary guest fee is a flat $450, which includes all scheduled meals and functions. Guests are <em>not </em>eligible to attend any business sessions other than the general sessions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: May I sign my staff members up as my guests?</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>A: </strong>FINRA-registered staff members who plan to attend business sessions must sign up at the attendee rate based on their own individual production. Production levels are <em>not</em> transferable within offices.</p></p>
